        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>As a math and art enthusiast, getting into the Computer Science and Mathematics major was quite a challenge for someone like me who never coded before. But I was very lucky that I was able to get to know the art of Computer Science, UI/UX Design. Despite studying computer science and mathematics for several years in college, my passion for art is undeniable and my love for UI/UX Design grows stronger by the day. I am always enthusiastic and contribute as much as possible in every job I do, even in group work. especially if I get the task to create the UI for an application, website or any kind of programme that my group is working on, I can't be more happier.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the first semester of college in 2021, I also started a small business called Diascia Attelier, which specialized in producing unique crochet products. From only selling on Shopee, now Diascia Attelier is selling offline at several art markets. Our next market is at Kira Kira Art Market 03 and Comifuro 19, if you have the time please do stop by!</p>
