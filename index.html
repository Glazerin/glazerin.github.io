        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>&emsp;As a math and art enthusiast, getting into the Computer Science and Mathematics major was quite a
            challenge for someone like me who never coded before. But I was very lucky that I was able to get to know
            the art of Computer Science, which are UI/UX Design and Front End Development. Despite studying computer science and mathematics for several
            years in college, my passion for art is undeniable and my love for UI/UX Design and Front End grew stronger by the day. I
            am always enthusiastic and contribute as much as possible in every job I do, even in group work. especially
            if I get the task to create the UI for an application, Front End for website or any kind of programme that my group is
            working on, I can't be more happier.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;At the beginning of the first semester of college in 2021, I also started a small business called
            Diascia Attelier, which specialized in producing unique crochet products. From only selling on Shopee, now
            Diascia Attelier is selling offline at several art markets. Our recent market is at Kira Kira Art Market 03
            and Comifuro 19, if you came to those events maybe you've met me there (or maybe not).</p>

            <h4>Education Counselor of Bina Nusantara University</h4>
            <p>Bina Nusantara University | May 2021 - July 2022</p>
            <p>After graduating from high school, I basically have nothing to do. So I was looking for a side hustle to
                fill up my time, and I got the invitation email to join the Education Counselor team of my university.
                This job required very good communication and marketing skills. Before college I've never joined any
                student organization (student council) and only focused myself on studying, so I believed that joining
                the Education Counselor team would benefit me in every way. The job description includes attracting high
                school students who will soon graduate to enter Bina Nusantara University, guiding them before the
                entrance exam and reminding them to make an initial payment before starting their studies. From this
                side hustle, I've earned my first ever money from my own struggles. The amount was quite much and I'm
                proud of it.</p>

            <h4>Pengabdian Pada Masyarakat (P2M) 2023 by HIMMAT</h4>
            <p>Panti Asuhan Adinda | March - May 2023</p>
            <p>As part of Himpunan Mahasiswa Matematika's annual agenda, association administrators and avtivists carry
                out social activities aimed at helping people in need. The event is called P2M, and in 2023 we held it
                at Adinda Orphanage. We gave them clothes, basic necessities, and played many math games together. At
                that time I'm helping the funding division as HIMMAT's Treasurer.</p>

            <h4>Pengabdian Pada Masyarakat (P2M) 2022 by HIMMAT</h4>
            <p>Zoom Meetings (Online) | March - April 2022</p>
            <p>As part of Himpunan Mahasiswa Matematika's annual agenda, association administrators and avtivists carry
                out social activities aimed at helping people in need. But in 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic was still
                rampant, so every event of HIMMAT was held online. Via Zoom Meetings, we organized P2M 2022 by teaching
                Java programming language to high schoolers and Binusian that's interested to learn. I was in the event
                division, preparing all the things we'll need.</p>

            <h4>HIMMAT Activist</h4>
            <p>Bina Nusantara University | February 2022 - February 2023</p>
            <p>As an activist of HIMMAT, I contributed in preparing several events with different position; event
                division of P2M HIMMAT 2022, funding division coordinator of HIMMAT Birthday and Competition 2022,
                funding and transport division coordinator for MATIC 2022, leader of Welcoming Party HIMMAT 2022 for
                Binusian 2026 and funding division of LDK-A (Latihan Dasar Kepemimpinan Aktivis) 2023. In conclusion, I
                contributed in many HIMMAT events mostly as part of the funding division.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>HIMMAT Treasurer</h4>
            <p>Bina Nusantara University | February 2023 - February 2024</p>
            <p>After being an activist for about a year, I took the role as one of HIMMAT's administrators, the
                Treasurer, at the choice of the next Chairman. For a year, I'm responsible in taking care of HIMMAT's
                financial bookkeeeping, making decisions together with the Chairman and Secretary, and guiding the
                funding divisions of HIMMAT's various events so that their funding reports won't be having any single
                mistake. After retiring from the position, I then became a passive HIMMAT member, giving chances to the
                younger generations so that they too can learn something from HIMMAT.</p>

                an idea to make an independent
                HIMMAT website, since our website becomes one with BINUS' and we didn't really like it. So we got a plan
                to try making one but eventually we're too busy that semester and our Secretary had a full time job too
                (he's in charge for the back end) so the project was neglected and I only managed to make this Hero
                Page. Personally I'm quite satisfied with it and kinda had fun making it because I had the chance to
                play and practice with the shapes.</p>

                always, I'm grateful). The design is quite simple and professional because we're short in time and
                before the end of the semester we need to finish the application wholly. Foo-Yoh! is a mobile app that
                specializes in selling recipes and fresh ingredients needed for the recipe. We came up with this idea
                while thinking about the many people that lack daily nutritions because they can't even cook on their
                own and will either skip meals or buy some fast foods.</p>
